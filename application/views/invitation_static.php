<li>Luxury brands and distinguished corporations may lose their reputation and value when their competitors appear on the UAE Top 10 list, when they don’t.</li>
<li>Competitors will capture major chunk of current market and will further make inroads to budding markets which will result in potential loss of customers.</li>
